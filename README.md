Hi! 👋 I'm Matthieu ! 

After 10 years as a Print/Graphic Designer, I'm finally starting a new career challenge in web development, as a junior!

I'm trained in Ruby & Ruby on Rails, JS, HTML/CSS, Git and GitHub, PostgreSQL thanks to Le Wagon Bordeaux.

Already 2️⃣ delivered projects for Le Wagon, in collaboration 🤝 with MelanieCouronne and chrismarchand :

🚀 MamieExpress : https://mamieexpress.herokuapp.com/

🚀 Buddy-bot : https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/6309521?key=164e5ff41d72b5a399e7fd99187858a9

🚀 EsyCar: https://ezycar.herokuapp.com/

As my training at Le Wagon is over, I'm starting to learn by myself, by reading Ruby on Rails Tutorial 📖, and JavaScript Channel.
I'm always curious and i love learning ! It's just the very first start of coding life.

Languages and Tools:
bootstrap, css3, figma, heroku, html5, illustrator, mysql, photoshop, postgresql, rails, ruby, xd
